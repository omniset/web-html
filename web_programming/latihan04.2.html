<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am<i>extremely</i>excited about a new cooking technique called<i>sous</i> vide.
    In <i>sous vide </i>cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
    water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
    cooked to. In his book <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-
    temperature poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide </i>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve
a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Warning:<i>Sous vide </i>cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
    immunity issues.</p>
